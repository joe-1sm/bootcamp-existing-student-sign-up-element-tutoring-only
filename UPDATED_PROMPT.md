I'd actually like to change up a couple things for how we're displaying these prices. I just realized we don't need the boxes side by side. In the box where it currently says Add weekly tutor check-in sessionjs? at the top, I want to rework that box so that it is left-aligned. The header should be something like 'Choose Your Winter Break Bootcamp Approach'. 

At the bottom of that box, also left-aligned there should be a 'Amount due at checkout: $3750' string with the price in bold. The $XXXX number will be contingent upon answers to questions above in the box.
 
Immediately below the header of the box, there should be a question that says 'Are you a current MCAT student with 1SM?' There should be bubbles for Yes and No. When Yes is selected, the $3750 at the bottom next to total due should receive a strikethrough and become less opaque and to the right of it there should be a new, bold $1490. Above this but below the header and first question there should be line items appear with the first being -1SM Winter Break MCAT Bootcamp  + $3750' and the second being '1SM existing student Bootcamp discount (60% Black Friday)  - $2260'

At the same time the first question is answered a second question should appear that says 'Would you like to add weekly check-ins to monitor your progress, refine your strategies, and adapt your study plan?' This should also have Yes and No options to select. If Yes is selected, two more line items should be added below the '1SM existing student Bootcamp discount (60% Black Friday)  - $2260'. The first one should be 'Weekly personalized check-ins  + $980' and then below that should say '1SM existing student check-in discount (50% Black Friday)  - $490'. Note that neither of these discounts should appear if the first question 'Are you a current MCAT student with 1SM?' is answered as No. Morever, if the second question is answered as No then neither of these line items (neither Weekly personalized check-ins  + $980' nor '1SM existing student check-in discount (50% Black Friday)  - $490') should appear. Supposing the answers to the first two questions were yes, the 'Amount due at checkout: $XXXX' string should update so that the $3750 that was crossed out becomes a crossed out $4730 and the amount in bold next to it becomes $1980.

Regardless, once the second question is answered, a third question should appear below the second and above the first line item. The third question should say 'Would you like to sign up in monthly installments?' and the answer choices should be 'one-time payment', '2 monthly installments', and '3 monthly installments'. if the user selects either 2 monthly installments or 3 monthly installments then text should appear below the 'Proceed to Checkout' Button, which is below the box all of this is happening in. The text that should appear says 'By agreeing signing up for this plan, I am agreeing to payment of 'X' (where is the number selected) monthly installments of 'Y' (where Y is the amount due at checkout on the very bottom line we've been referencing.

When the user selects an answer to this third question, the line items should summarize to show a 'Total amount due' below the bottom item, separated by a straight line. If the user selected one-time payment then that's all that happens and the 'Proceed to Checkout' button goes from being grayed out to our official brand color, indicating it can be selected. if the user selected one of the other two options then another item appears below the total amount due that indicates the amount is being divided into X monthly installments (where X=the number chosen for question 3). Then another item should appear below that stating the user would be signing up for their plan (Winter Break MCAT Bootcamp [with Weekly Tutor Check-Ins]) in X installments of $Y per month (where X is number of months selected and Y is the total due at checkout, which is reflected at the bottom of the box. Here too the button to proceed to checkout should become red.

Obviously we need to have a backend file that includes all the links that could correspond to every permutation of this plan. These links can be included as simple URLs.
